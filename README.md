# Exercise 1
Write a program that will have the YEAR constant with the specified value (choose any value, it does not have to be the current year). The console program should display whether the year is a leap year. The program should be run by command: "node index.js".
# Exercise 2
Write a program that will draw an integer between 1 and 10. The program will then allow the user to type their "shot" into the console. If the user guesses, the program will display the information "Successful", otherwise: "Try again". You should use readline- then let your first application run on the command: "npm run readline", and prompt- then let your second application run on the command: "npm run prompt".
